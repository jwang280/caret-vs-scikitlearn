# Caret versus Scikit-Learn
A systematical comparison of the characters between the two packages on machine learning in detail with pros and cons.

Caret provides one of the most comprehensive wrappers for any set of R packages and can be solely used to define an entire workflow starting from data cleaning and preprocessing, all the way through model training, prediction, and performance analysis. Plus, it is free to use. Caret can perform various data mining functionalities easier and more in a more user-friendly way. 

On the other hand, Scikit-learn provides the same functionalities in Python. It is also an open-source package which is free to use. Scikit-learn is designed for Data Mining and Machine Learning. Since Python is a widely-used language, it is more likely to be implemented in various applications. Scikit-learntrains models faster and sometimes more accurately due to how Python stores the data as matrices.
